When discussing contracts on sporting forums, people tend to use the term "resign" wrongly. For example, "Lebron James is expected to resign at the end of the year" - it usually means that he is intending to re-sign / renew his contract, instead of resigning from the team.

This is a simple reddit bot that scours through a specified subreddit and correct comments with "resign", correcting them to be "re-sign". I ran the bot for two days on /r/nba with 30+ corrections and zero false positives, but was banned from the sub for "spam".

If you would like this bot to be deployed on your sub, feel free to contact me.
